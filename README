Included are several implementations of a recursive algorithm to calculate the
nth Fibonacci number, along with invoking shell scripts for each.

You may implement your assignments in any of the following languages:
    * C17 (The compiler, GCC 11.2.0, also supports the upcoming C2x standard.)
    * Python 3.10.3
    * Java 17.0.2
    * Node.js 16.17.0 (TypeScript 4.8.2 is also installed.)
    * Clojure 1.11.1
    * Kotlin 1.7.10 (This is JVM-backed Kotlin, not Kotlin/Native.)

To make automated grading possible, you will also need to submit two short
shell scripts: one to compile your submission, one to run it. For example, all
of the included Fibonacci implementations can be run using:

    >$ ./compile.sh
    >$ ./run.sh 12
    144

Furthermore:
    * For record-keeping purposes, you must submit only original source files.
      Any directories, pre-compiled files, or compressed files will be ignored.
    * You may not use *any* third party libraries (and your script won't have
      Internet access when it's run, so you can't use apt/pip/npm/etc. to
      install them), even if they are installed on Cal Poly's Unix servers.

Everything you need to know about shell scripts to write your own script:
    * Every shell script should start with a "shebang", which tells the OS how
      to execute the file. To intrepret your script using Bash, which is the
      default shell in this class's Linux grading environment:

        #!/bin/sh

    * In Bash, basically every value is a string. Bash interprets certain
      strings as integers, depending on the context, and it has limited support
      for associative arrays.

    * In Bash, a variable is declared as follows (note the lack of spaces):

        mystr="foo"

    * In Bash, a variable is referenced by prefacing it with a dollar sign:

        $mystr

    * In Bash, a program is invoked in the same way as at the command prompt:

        echo "Hello, world!"

    * ...and variables can be used as arguments:

        echo $mystr

    * ...but, to ensure that a variable's value is treated as one argument, it
      should quoted (in case it evaluates to a string containing spaces):

        echo "$mystr"

    * In bash, the command line arguments are variables numbered from 1:

        $1, $2, $3, ...

    * So, a Bash script to run your Python submission might look like:

        #!/bin/sh
        python3 my_program.py "$1"

      Which says, "This is a Bash script. Run my_program.py through the Python
      interpreter, passing it the same first argument that was passed to you."
